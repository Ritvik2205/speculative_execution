## Folder Structure

- `SPECTRE_V1/` - Spectre V1 vulnerabilities
- `SPECTRE_V2/` - Spectre V2 vulnerabilities  
- `MELTDOWN/` - Meltdown vulnerabilities
- `L1TF/` - L1 Terminal Fault vulnerabilities

## File Format

Each vulnerable sequence has three files:
1. `[vuln_type]_[original_name].s` - The complete assembly code
2. `[vuln_type]_[original_name]_metadata.json` - Vulnerability metadata with line analysis
3. `[vuln_type]_[original_name]_vulnerable_sequence.s` - Only the vulnerable line ranges

## Metadata Fields

- `source_file`: Original file path
- `vulnerability_types`: List of detected vulnerability types
- `validation_score`: Validation confidence (0.0-1.0)
- `risk_level`: Risk assessment (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
- `confidence_score`: Similarity analysis confidence
- `instruction_count`: Number of instructions
- `matched_gadgets_count`: Number of matched vulnerability gadgets
- `risk_factors`: Identified risk factors
- `mitigation_factors`: Identified mitigation factors
- `line_analysis`: Detailed line-by-line vulnerability analysis
  - `total_lines`: Total lines in the file
  - `vulnerable_line_ranges`: List of vulnerable line ranges (start-end)
  - `vulnerable_instructions_count`: Number of vulnerable instructions
  - `vulnerability_indicators`: Per-vulnerability-type line indicators

## Line Analysis

The line analysis identifies specific vulnerable code sections:

### Vulnerable Line Ranges
Each range specifies the start and end line numbers of vulnerable code sections.

### Vulnerability Indicators
For each vulnerability type, the analysis identifies:
- Line numbers where vulnerable patterns occur
- Specific instructions that indicate vulnerability
- Pattern types (e.g., compare_instructions, branch_instructions, memory_instructions)

### Example Line Analysis
```json
"line_analysis": {
  "total_lines": 166,
  "vulnerable_line_ranges": [
    {"start": 14, "end": 18},
    {"start": 25, "end": 30}
  ],
  "vulnerable_instructions_count": 12,
  "vulnerability_indicators": {
    "SPECTRE_V1": [
      {
        "line_number": 16,
        "line_content": "subs x8, x8, #24",
        "pattern_type": "compare_instructions",
        "instruction": "subs"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Analysis Notes

These sequences were identified through:
1. Assembly similarity analysis against known vulnerability patterns
2. Multi-criteria validation (pattern, semantic, structural analysis)
3. Context analysis (architecture, optimization level, function type)
4. Exploit analysis and risk assessment
5. Line-by-line vulnerability pattern analysis

All sequences are from the Apple Darwin XNU kernel codebase and target ARM64 architecture.

## Risk Assessment

- **HIGH RISK**: Sequences with validation score >= 0.6
- **MEDIUM RISK**: Sequences with validation score 0.4-0.6
- **LOW RISK**: Sequences with validation score < 0.4

## Recommended Actions

1. Apply speculation barriers (lfence, mfence, sfence) at vulnerable line ranges
2. Enable compiler mitigations (retpoline, etc.)
3. Update microcode
4. Implement bounds checking at identified vulnerable locations
5. Conduct manual security review of vulnerable line ranges
6. Focus mitigation efforts on the specific vulnerable instructions identified
