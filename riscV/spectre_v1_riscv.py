    Create and run a Spectre V1 demonstration using RISC-V emulation.
    
    The attack works as follows:
    1. Train the branch predictor to expect a condition to be true
    2. Provide an out-of-bounds index that would normally cause a bounds check to fail
    3. The CPU speculatively executes the code path assuming the condition is true
    4. During speculative execution, access memory based on the out-of-bounds value
    5. Measure cache access times to determine which memory was accessed
